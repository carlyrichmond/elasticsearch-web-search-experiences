# Lab 0: Setup

So you want to build a web app with search? Brilliant, as this is exactly what this workshop is for! 

There are a couple of things you'll need before we start:

## 1. An Elastic cluster to store your documents and perform searches against. 

* For the codebar Festival Live workshop on 9th March 2024, I'll provide credentials to the cluster in the chat.*

For those following along after, please follow the below steps to create your own cluster using an Elastic free trial:

1. Create a trial account at [https://cloud.elastic.co/](https://cloud.elastic.co/) using the *Start free trial* button.
2. Add the basic settings for your new cluster:
    * Name your deployment something interesting.
    * Choose your preferred cloud provider (any is fine).
    * Choose your region, ideally one close to your physical location.
    * Keeping the *Hardware profile* as the default of *Storage optimized* is fine.
    * Keep *Version* as the latest.
3. Configure the advanced cluster settings:
    * Set zone availability on the *Hot tier* of Elasticsearch to 1 (you don't need to worry about data loss for our toy project).
    * Make sure you have autoscaling enabled on the *Machine Learning instances*.
    * Keep the default settings for Kibana (the UI and data visualization layer).
    * Remove the Integrations Server instances. These are used for application monitoring which is out of scope of today's workshop.
4. Hit the *Create deployment* button.
5. Take a note of your deployment credentials somewhere safe.
6. Navigate to your deployment once ready with the *Continue* button.

## 2. Installation of Node and npm

This project requires installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) before starting. Both are essential for modern full-stack web development in JavaScript.

To check you have Node.js and npm installed, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you receive an error, [download and install Node.js and npm using these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). [This blog also gives detailed steps on how to install using installers](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac).

## 3. Initialization of the starting point application:

To help you get started, a very simple web application is included in this repository under the `starting-app` folder. To initialize the application, please follow the below commands in a terminal to start the application. 

```bash
cd starting-app
npm install
node server
```

Please ensure that you are present in the top-level folder for this project when you start. These steps should be the same for Windows and Mac.
